# Reactive BPM

This is a collection of tools to support a reactive BPM approach using [Red Hat Process Automation Manager](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhpam/overview/). In particular, this repository aims to provide teams a prescriptive approach for transforming [an Event Storm] into executable documentation that will accompany their application at runtime. The approach was described in detail at [Explore DDD 2018](https://www.slideshare.net/JustinHolmes2/visualizing-your-event-storm-in-new-ways). The talk was recorded and will be available soon.
